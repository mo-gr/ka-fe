    <h2>Katja Feil - Health Coach</h2>
    <article>
        <p>
            Katja, originally from Berlin Germany, now lives and works as a Health Coach in her chosen home town Sydney. Her mantra:
            <strong>Do what you love!</strong>
        <p>
            She attained her university <strong>degree in Mathematics and Economics</strong> at Freie Universität Berlin. While studying, Katja gained her first experience in the field of IT Project Management and remained dedicated to it. In her more than five years as a successful Agile Product & Project Manager in various companies, she was able to implement cross-departmental, revenue-relevant projects on time, and was a trusted partner, valued team player and mentor for her colleagues.
            During that time Katja discovered her passion for coaching as she started to work as a mentor and business coach for startups in a Berlin-based incubator program. Katja loves to
        <strong>share her methodical knowledge</strong> and practical experience with others and <strong>enable them to
        achieve their goals</strong>.
        <p>
            That’s why Katja decided to take her career to the next level and combine her knowledge and experience from the IT environment with her
        <strong>passion for business coaching</strong> and a good work-life balance. Therefore she completed a 6-month training to become a
        <strong>certified Health Coach</strong> and another training to become a <strong>Yoga Teacher</strong>.
        <p>
            In 2019 she <strong>successfully founded her own Health Coaching business</strong> and is now helping others to achieve their personal goals. Whether it’s to be more successful at work or to overcome private obstacles, you’re in charge and you are capable.
        <p>
            Besides Katja's huge passion for nutrition, fitness, and movement she is fascinated by the human body and learns more about it every day. Anatomy, biomechanics, prevention and regeneration, metabolism and nutrition – are just a few of the topics she works on.
        <p>
            <h2>What is a Health Coach?</h2>
        <p>
            You wonder what a Health Coach is and why Health Coaches are becoming more and more important these days? In short: A Health Coach is someone who supports you in shaping your life in the way you want. He also will help you to set achievable goals and support you on your way, to overcome obstacles and to successfully achieve your personal goals.
