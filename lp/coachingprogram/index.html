        <li>Your anxiety and fear of not being good enough makes you feel paralyzed</li>
        <li>You are exhausted and stressed out after a day at work</li>
        <li>You have low energy levels and feel tired, but still have problems to fall asleep</li>
        <li>You are unmotivated to do things that will bring you joy</li>
        <li>You feel stuck in your daily routine and don‚Äôt see any options for change</li>

        <p>From the outside, everything looks just perfect and you often hear ‚Äúyou are fine‚Äù, but from the inside, you are definitely not fine. You are not happy. You don‚Äôt want to accept that situation and you are ready to face it.

            <h2>Katja Feil</h2>
            <p>
                My name is Katja, and I‚Äôve spent the last 2 years of my career helping women optimize their health.
                I brought my career to the next level and founded my own business as a health & business coach and moved to Sydney, Australia.
                I found my passion for coaching while I was still working in the corporate world.
                I know what it means to work in an office and I felt the pressure of being a successful woman.

        <p><h3>My Approach includes 3 Steps that I personalize for each of my clients</h3>
        <p>
        <p><strong>1. Kick start your health / Quick fixes.</strong> You know you have completed this stage when you're feeling more energized and confident trough-out your day at work. In this stage, we will identify your goals, set up a strategy to achieve them, and get you rolling.
        <p>
        <p><strong>2. Breaking office habits.</strong> You feel less stressed and more balanced at work and after work, plus you start losing weight. In this stage, we pin down your blockers and remove them. Additionally, we introduce some easy and efficient movement- and self-care practices to fix bad postural habits, reduce back/neck pain and establish much-needed you-time.
        <p>
        <p><strong>3. Use the momentum/setup for success/road_to success.</strong> You have a longterm vision for your health journey. We will work on setting boundaries to improve your wellness, sleep, and stress management. This stage will leave you feeling more resilient and well prepared for whatever life throws at you.
