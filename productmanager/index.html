    <h1>Product Manager Profile</h1>
    <article>
        <p>
            Katja, originally from Berlin Germany, now lives and works as a <strong>Senior Product Manager</strong> in her chosen home town Sydney. Her mantra:
            <strong>Building the right thing!</strong>
        <p>
            Her way of working is self-organized and in close collaboration with her team. Therefore mutual trust is very important for her. As a Product Manager, she feels a
        <strong>strong responsibility for her product</strong> and her development teams. If the team is happy, she's happy and they deliver high quality faster. Katja loves to come
        <strong>straight to the point</strong>, everything else is a waste of time. She has little tolerance for micro-management or arbitrary top-down decisions. Expect her to ask for good reasons and solid arguments.
        <p>
            Colleagues usually describe her as a motivating, data-driven, accessible, structured, loyal, and ‚Äúgo-to for good advice‚Äù-person. Friends and family would add characteristics such as helpful, sportive, curious, and somehow funny.
        <p>
            After successfully finishing her degree in <strong>Mathematic & Economics at Freie Universit√§t Berlin</strong>, she started to work as Productmanager at Mobile.International GmbH ‚Äì an Ebay Company. Breathing in the agile product development, she decided to dive into the startup culture in Berlin. She successfully
        <strong>introduced agile software development in several startups</strong> and helped to build up organizational structure. In order to bring her knowledge to the next level, she decided to wok for one of the biggest tech companies in Berlin.
        <p>
            Besides the typical daily business as Product Manager like working with Scrum and Kanban, creating roadmaps and backlogs, writing stories, working closely with developers, data science, UX/UI, marketing, sales, preparing product tests, doing market research, product improvements and having fun with her team. Katja started to focus more on
        <strong>product strategy, longterm goals and business development</strong>, which she presented to the board.
            Katja also started <strong>public speaking</strong> on the company‚Äôs road show and on customer events as an expert for the real estate market. Additionally, she was giving workshop and trainings for sales and customers.
        <p>
            After working for nearly five years at Immobilienscout24, she moved on to work at 21st Real Estate, one of Germany's most successful PropTech start-ups.
        <strong>Consulting</strong> big banks in their <strong>software solutions</strong> and <strong>optimizing their
        product development process</strong>.
        <p>
            Additionally, in 2015, she discovered her passion for coaching and teaching when she started to work as a mentor and business coach for startups. She loves to
        <strong>share her methodical knowledge</strong> and practical experience with others and enable them to achieve their goals.
        <p>
            Besides Product Management, Katja is passionate about traveling the world and health. Therefore she started her
        <strong>own business as Health Coach and Yoga Teacher</strong>. She believes in a good work-life balance. For her it's a balance between her office job, movement to feel alive, mindfulness and meditation to reduce stress, and nutrition to feel balanced.
